## All Code in This repository is created by Zac Sims

- The main notebook, 'LSTM Model.ipynb', contains the Reccurent Neural Network Model that predicts whether the next pitch thrown is a fastball or not based off a learned encoding of the last three pitches and an encoding of the game situation before the pitch.
- The notebook 'Comparision Models.ipynb'  contains trivial sklearn models to compare with the results of the LSTM model.
- The python file 'pitcher.py' contains the helper functions to format the data for input into the LSTM model and for all of the models in general.
